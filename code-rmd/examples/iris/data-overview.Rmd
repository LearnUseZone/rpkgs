# History of iris dataset
> The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by
the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. \
The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. \
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of
Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). \
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and
the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

# Data overview of iris dataset
## Observations, variables, names
Dataset `iris` has **`r dimensions[1]` observations**
and **`r dimensions[2]` variables**
and its **class name** is **\"`r class_name`\"**.

```{r names, comment = ''}
base::message("Variable (column) names of iris dataset are:", "\n",
  base::paste(var_names, collapse = "\n")          
)
```

## Head, tail, summary
```{r head-and-tail, class.source = 'fold-show'}
# the 1st 4 and the last 4 observations
base::print(base::rbind(head_iris, tail_iris))

# print summary
base::print(summary_iris)
```
