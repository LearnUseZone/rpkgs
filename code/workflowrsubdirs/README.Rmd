## Purpose
- It's an optional extension of package [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) in order to be able to render .html pages from .Rmd files saved in subdirectories of a workflowr project.
  - Use workflowr if .Rmd files from directory \"analysis\" are rendered.
  - Use workflowrsubdirs if .Rmd files from subdirectories are rendered.
- I suggest to create a new directory, for your .Rmd files saved in subdirectories, directly in your workflowr project's working directory (and not in directory \"analysis\").
  - For example: create directory \"code-rmd\" in the same directory as directory \"code\".



## General rules
- This package is an extension for package \"workflowr\" therefore it's needed
  to have the same structure of directories \"analysis\", \"code\" and \"docs\" as for workflowr.
  - When you create your directory for .Rmd files in subdirectories
    - it has to be in the same directory as previous 3 directories.
    - I suggest to create a directory \"code-rmd\" as this is also the default directory in function
      generate_html() (see below).
- .Rmd files containing \"\-\-\" (two hyphens) are not allowed in directory \"analysis\".


### Avoid problems with YAML header of .Rmd files in subdirectories
- Example of inline R code that can cause problems with rendering .Rmd file to .html file: \
date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&#x060;r paste(\"Last update:\", format(lubridate::with_tz(as.POSIXct(Sys.time()) + 7200, tzone = \"GMT\"), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M GMT+2\"))&#x060;\"\
- Summary:
  - Use single quotation marks for inline R codes in YAML header in .Rmd files saved in directory analysis, e.g.: \
  \"&#x060;r paste(\'Last update:\', ...
  - Use escaped double quotation marks for inline R codes in YAML header in .Rmd files saved in subdirectories, e.g.: \
  \"&#x060;r paste(\\\"Last update:\\\", ...
- More information:
  - If a single quotation mark (\') is used then two consecutive single quotation marks (\'\')
    are created in YAML header in a temporary .Rmd file (will be deleted after .html file is rendere)
    that is temporarily created in directory analysis (this file is used to render a final .html file).
    - Usage of a single quotation marks is working for workflowr::wflow_build(\"analysis/test-file-date.Rmd\").
  - If a double quotation mark (\") is used then error is displayed.
    - The same error is displayed also for workflowr::wflow_build(\"analysis/test-file-date.Rmd\").
  - If an escaped single quotation mark (\\') is used then error is displayed.
    - The same error is displayed also for workflowr::wflow_build(\"analysis/test-file-date.Rmd\").
  - If an escaped double quotation mark (\\") is used then rendering a temporary .Rmd file to .html file works.
    - An error is displayed for workflowr::wflow_build(\"analysis/test-file-date.Rmd\").



## Briefly about package function render_html()
- This package contains more functions but only render_html() is visible for a user.
- Package "workflowr" is used for commits during processing and also for building .html pages.

#### Main steps
1. Evaluate if rendering of .html files is possible. If some check doesn't pass,
   write a reason and stop processing.
   - Used package function: initial_checks()
2. Create paths (in a form of matrix with characters or character vector) to original .Rmd files
   intended for future rendering into .html files.
   - Used package function: create_rmd_paths()
3. Generate temporary (helping) .Rmd files, from their original .Rmd files, in directory "analysis".
   - Used package function: generate_rmd()
4. If commit == TRUE, create a commit of these temporary (helping) .Rmd files with text
   "separate commit of temporary .Rmd files".
   - Used function: workflowr::wflow_git_commit()
   - If these temporary (helping) .Rmd files are not committed before workflowr::wflow_build(),
     following unwanted error message is written after opening of any prepared .html file and
     left-clicking on "workflowr" button under tab \"Checks\": \"R Markdown file: uncommitted changes\" 
       - This is also in line with \"workflowr\" package.
5. Render temporary .Rmd files in directory "analysis" into .html files.
   - Used function: workflowr::wflow_build()
   - Final .html files are prepared (also package workflowr is set in this way)
     in directory \"docs\" (for GitHub) or directory \"public\" (for GitLab).
     Each such file name contains \"\-\-\" which are delimiters
     for paths to original .Rmd files paths.
6. Remove temporary (helping) .Rmd files from directory "analysis".


#### Other important information
- Even when relevant temporary files were committed separately (see above),
it's necessary to commit all files after .html files are prepared
  - Commit of all removed (see below) temporary .Rmd files and new .html files).
- If other than workflowr project is originally opened using its .Rproj file then this function fails because \"base::setwd(here::here())\" in this function sets a working directory to an original .Rproj working directory regardless a current working directory (e.g. set after opening .Rproj). Potentially if a relevant .Rproj working directory have the same structure then it could work but I didn't test it, yet.
  - This type of issue can be considered after running \"workflowrsubdirs::generate_html()\", the following error message arises in \"Console\" tab:
  Error in base::mapply(generate_rmd, dir, file_path, temp_file) : 
  zero-length inputs cannot be mixed with those of non-zero length
    - \"base::mapply(generate_rmd, dir, file_path, temp_file)" is called inside function "workflowrsubdirs::generate_html()\".
- Add better explanation for input parameters
  - .Rmd or .rmd at the end of pattern is required (also that "." is required)



## Installation
- Option 1
  - Clone this Git [rpkgs repository](https://github.com/LearnUseZone/rpkgs).
  - Open rpkgs/code/workflowrsubdirs/workflowrsubdirs/workflowrsubdirs.Rproj in RStudio.
  - Build (from top menu) -> Install and Restart (Ctrl+Shift+B)

- Option 2
  - Do steps from Option 1 until opening .Rproj in RStudio in Option 1 (include also this step)
  - Build (from top menu) -> Build Source Package -> wait until .tar.gz file is created.
  - Run R code: install.packages(<path_to_tar.gz_file>, repos = NULL, type = \"source\")


### Try following steps if the package weren't installed successfully:\
  1. Check if the package is in RStudio \"Packages\" tab and if yes, uninstall it.
  2. Check if directory \"workflowrsubdirs\" exists within directory “library” with your installed R packages and if it exists, delete it.
  3. Restart R session e.g. using RStudio -> Session -> Restart R.
  4. Install the package again using\
    a) Install and Restart (Ctrl+Shift+B) or\
    b) install.packages(<path_to_tar.gz_file>, repos = NULL, type = \"source\").



## Needed packages
- Before you can fully use this package make sure you have installed following packages (their loading isn't necessary):\
  - base
  - here
  - knitr
  - rmarkdown
  - stringr
  - workflowr
  - yaml



## Example
- At the beginning a working directory of package \"workflowr\" needs to be prepared. You can find relevant steps
  together with more information like usage of (required and optional) workflowr subdirectories
  [here](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html)
- You can use directory "code" for codes that might not be appropriate to include in R Markdown format
  (e.g. for pre-processing the data, or for long-running code). You can have also subdirectories here.
- If you want to render .Rmd files (showing results of your .R files from directory \"code\")
  to .html files using purely package \"workflowr\", save relevant .Rmd files into directory \"analysis\".
- If you like to have the same structure as .R files also for your .Rmd files, you can create
  a new directory, e.g. \"code-rmd\", and create relevant subdirectories together with associated
  .Rmd files (these .Rmd files could be also in subdirectories of directory "code" but I think it could be less organized or clear).
  - Don't use directory \"analysis\" for this purpose.
  Now, because you have .Rmd files in subdirectories under directory code-rmd, use this package workflowrsubdir to render .html files.
- Examples: Consider following files\
  - \"code-rmd/subdir/testfile1.Rmd\",
  - \"code-rmd/subdir/testfile2.rmd\",
  - \"code-rmd/subdir/testdir/testfile1.Rmd\",
  - \"code-rmd/subdir/testdir/my-analyses.Rmd\"
  - If you want to render all those files, you can use several options, like:
    - workflowrsubdirs::generate_html()  # if there are other files in \"code-rmd\" or it's subdirectories, those files will be processed, too
    - workflowrsubdirs::generate_html(dirs = \"code-rmd/subdir\")  # all files in directories and subdirectories of \"code-rmd/subdir\" will be       processed
    - workflowrsubdirs::generate_html(dirs = \"code-rmd\\\\subdir\") # all files in directories and subdirectories of \"code-rmd/subdir\" will be       processed
    - workflowrsubdirs::generate_html(dirs = \"code-rmd/subdir\", orig_rmd_patterns = \".\*.(r|R)md$\")
    - workflowrsubdirs::generate_html(dirs = \"code-rmd/subdir\", orig_rmd_patterns = c(\"^test.\*.rmd$\", \"file1.Rmd\", \"-.\*.[ R , r ]md\"))
- Important note: If orig_rmd_patterns isn't NULL then it always has to end with .rmd, .Rmd, .rmd\$, .Rmd\$ or
  a relevant regular expression that after evaluation point to one of those 4 extensions.
  - This is made in accordance to behaviour of package \"workflowr\" which allows only .rmd or .Rmd extensions.
  
- Note: A real example with .Rmd files in subdirectories (under directory codeRmd in this case) can be found [here](https://github.com/LearnUseZone/workflowrSubfolders).
  - Use this only for your better overview of managing directories because this package is enhanced
    against the original version used in \"workflowrSubfolders\".


### Usage of workflowrsubdirs after it\'s installed
1. After workflowrsubdirs is installed, open your workflowr project (run .Rproj file).
2. Use workflowrsubdirs::generate_html().
3. Remember that although commit of temporary .Rmd files were made within function workflowrsubdirs::generate_html(), you still have to commit the rest of files.
You can use for this purpose e.g.:
  - 3a. GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree or other Git desktop client.
  - 3b. Git Bash (also set as Terminal in RStudio) with git commands like:\
git branch -a       # I prefer to check whitch branch is checked out\
git add "."\
git commit -m "tested: package workflowrsubdirs"\
git push origin master
- 3c. Functions of package workflowr like:\
workflowr::wflow_git_commit(c("docs/subPages1--testPrint1.html", "docs/subPages2--testPrint2.html"), "tested: package workflowrsubdirs with workflowr", all = TRUE)\
workflowr::wflow_use_github(\"LearnUseZone\", \"workflowrSubfolders\")  # usually choose a default option which is 2\
workflowr::wflow_git_push()  # use your credentials to push your changes to checked out branch.\



## Additional notes
- I assume that you are using RStudio and therefore some parts of this or other documents may be focused on this assumption but of course the relevant associated steps (you need to know them) work also if you don\'t use RStudio.
- I'm still working on improvements therefore it can still be found for example
  - some placeholders like \"tests\testthat\test-generate_rmd.R\" and
  - notes for future improvements.
- Initial inspiration for this package is from [here](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/issues/95).\
- A related discussion with John Blischak (a creator of package workflowr) about a base set-up
  can be found [here](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/issues/220).
